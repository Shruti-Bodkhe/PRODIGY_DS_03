# PRODIGY_DS_03
A machine learning project using the Bank Marketing dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. Built using a Decision Tree Classifier, with full preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization.

# Bank Marketing - Decision Tree Classifier

## Objective
Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit using a Decision Tree.

## Dataset
- Source:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
- File: `bank-full.csv`

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

## Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
4. Train a Decision Tree Classifier (entropy-based)
5. Evaluate performance: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix
6. Visualize the decision tree structure

## Output
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Visual decision tree plot

## File Structure
- `BankMarketing_DecisionTree.ipynb`
- `bank-full.csv` 
- `tree_plot.png` 
- `README.md`
